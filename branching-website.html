    <h1>Branching</h1>
    <h2>A website to practice branching with Git</h2>
    <p>This page has been created in order to practice branching with <strong>Git and GitHub.</strong>
      By creating branches, we can work on different versions of the same code
      in the same repository <em>simultaneously!</em> </p>
